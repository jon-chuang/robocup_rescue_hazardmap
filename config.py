# Reason (by Isaac Asimov)
#
# ...
#
# “It’s done,” said the robot quietly, “and so I’ve come to have a talk with the two
# of you”
#  “Oh!” Powell looked uncomfortable. “Well, sit down. No, not that chair. One of
# the legs is weak and you’re no lightweight.”
#  The robot did so and said placidly, “I have come to a decision.”
#  Donovan glowered and put the remnants of his sandwich aside. “If it’s on any of
# that screwy--”
#  The other motioned impatiently for silence, “Go ahead, Cutie. We’re listening.”
#  “I have spent these last two days in concentrated introspection,” said Cutie, “and
# the results have been most interesting. I began at the one sure assumption I felt permitted
# to make. I, myself, exist, because I think--”
#  Powell groaned, “Oh, Jupiter, a robot Descartes!”
#  “Who’s Descartes?” demanded Donovan. “Listen, do we have to sit here and
# listen to this metal maniac--”
#  “Keep quiet, Mike!”
#  Cutie continued imperturbably, “And the question that immediately arose was:
# Just what is the cause of my existence?”
#  Powell’s jaw set lumpily. “You’re being foolish. I told you already that we made
# you.”
#  “And if you don’t believe us,” added Donovan, “we’ll gladly take you apart!”
#  The robot spread his strong hands in a deprecatory gesture, “I accept nothing on
# authority. A hypothesis must be backed by reason, or else it is worthless -- and it goes
# against all the dictates of logic to suppose that you made me.”
#  Powell dropped a restraining arm upon Donovan’s suddenly bunched fist. “Just
# why do you say that?”
#  Cutie laughed. It was a very inhuman laugh -- the most machine-like utterance he
# had yet given vent to. It was sharp and explosive, as regular as a metronome and as
# uninflected.
#  “Look at you,” he said finally. “I say this in no spirit of contempt, but look at you!
# The material you are made of is soft and flabby, lacking endurance and strength,
# depending for energy upon the inefficient oxidation of organic material -- like that.” He
# pointed a disapproving finger at what remained of Donovan’s sandwich. “Periodically
# you pass into a coma and the least variation in temperature, air pressure, humidity, or
# radiation intensity impairs your efficiency. You are makeshift.
#  “I, on the other hand, am a finished product. I absorb electrical energy directly
# and utilize it with an almost one hundred percent efficiency. I am composed of strong
# metal, am continuously conscious, and can stand extremes of environment easily. These
# are facts which, with the self-evident proposition that no being can create another being
# superior to itself, smashes your silly hypothesis to nothing.”
